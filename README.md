### Description:

What is fizzbuzz? It's a program that counts upwards from 1 and then outputting whole numbers except multiples of 3, which are replaced by "Fizz", and multiples of 5, replaced by "Buzz". Common multiples outpu "FizzBuzz". For example: 1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "Fizzbuzz", 16, and so on.

In this project I wanted to understand the FizzBuzz solution in C#. FizzBuzz I created this project a while ago but I wanted to create it again and update the repoistory so that it would show the correct informaiton. I had problems on the previous repository and decicded to start again.

I wanted to know how it worked within the code and to play around with so that I know if something breaks, I would know how to fix it. I wanted to understand it and know how it works because this is a famous solution and I wanted to be able to explain to someone how this works.

### Prerequisites:
- Visual Studio 2017 or higher (2019 Recommended)
- Windows 10 (OS)

### Instructions:
- Step 1: Download Visual Studio (If you don't have already)
- Step 2: Clone this project
- Step 3: Once downloading is finished, open it up using Visual Studio
- Step 4: Click run at the top and the application will run
- Step 5: It will show the user a console application and display the fizzbuzz

### What I Learnt:
- Forloop
- Comments
- Better understanding of C#

### Constraints:

I followed a tutorial from YouTube, so I didn't have any problems.

- Changes: Recreated Solution to FizzBuzz

I recreated this project and had no problems. I simply remembered how to create this project and because I have done it a few times before, I didn't have any problem doing it again.

- Changes: Created Solution to FizzBuzz

This project was first created at this date; however, I had a problem with my GitHub so I decided that I would remove this project and recreate it again.

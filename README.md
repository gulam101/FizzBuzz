### Description:

In this project I wanted to understand the FizzBuzz solution in C#. I wanted to know how it worked within the code and to play around with so that I know if something breaks, I would know how to fix it.

### What I Learnt:
- Forloop
- Comments
- Better understanding of C#

### Constraints:

I followed a tutorial from YouTube, so I didn't have any problems.

### Development Changes:

- Date: 1/13/20
- Changes: Readme

In this development phrase, I had completed the application but was finishing off the Readme.

- Date: 1/12/20
- Changes: Recreated Solution to FizzBuzz

I recreated this project and had no problems. I simply remembered how to create this project and because I have done it a few times before, I didn't have any problem doing it again.

- Date: 13/07/19
- Changes: Created Solution to FizzBuzz

This project was first created at this date; however, I had a problem with my GitHub so I decided that I would remove this project and recreate it again.
